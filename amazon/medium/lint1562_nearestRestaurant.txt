1562. Number of restaurants
中文English
Give a List of data representing the coordinates[x,y] of each restaurant and the customer is at the origin[0,0]. Find n closest restaurants to the customer, where m is the furthest distance from n restaurants to the customer. If there are more than n restaurants in the list and the distance from the customer is not greater than m, then the first n restaurants will be returned in the order of the elements in the list.

Example
Example 1

Input: n = 2 , List = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2]]
Output : [[0,0],[1,1]]
Explanation: The closest 2 restaurants are [0,0] and [1,1]. And only these two restaurants are in sqrt(2) meters.
Example 2

Input: n = 3,List = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,1],[1,0]]
Output:[[0,1],[1,2],[2,1]]
Explanation: The closest 3 restaurants are [0,1],[1,2] and [2,1]. And only these three restaurants are in sqrt(5) meters. 
Notice
1.Coordinates in range [-1000,1000]
2.n>0
3.No same coordinates

find the max distance first then go over the list to select n restaurants
