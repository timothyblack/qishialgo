363. Trapping Rain Water
中文English
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

Trapping Rain Water

Example
Example 1:

Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 0
Example 2:

Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Challenge
O(n) time and O(1) memory

O(n) time and O(n) memory is also acceptable.

1. stack
2, two pointer
